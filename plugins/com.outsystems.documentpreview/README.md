# File Viewer Plugin

Leverage your hybrid applications to open documents in a preview mode or with an external application.

This plugin defines a global ( `cordova.plugins.DocumentPreview` ) object which you can use to access the public API.


## Plugin

Although `DocumentPreview` is globally acessible, it isn't usable until `deviceready` event is called.

As with all the cordova plugins, you can listen to `deviceready` event as follows: 

```javascript
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
function onDeviceReady() {
    // ...
}
```

## Supported Platforms

 - iOS
 - Android 


## Installation
- Run the following command:

```shell
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/OutSystemsExperts/File-Viewer-Plugin.git
```
